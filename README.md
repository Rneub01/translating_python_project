There are only two files you need to worry about for this project: helpers.cpp and localizer.cpp. Here's what each file included in the starter code is for:

You can mostly ignore any .h (header) files, although if you add additional functions to .cpp files you should also define them within the related header file!

The maps folder just has data of the map data used in the project

tests.cpp is just for testing - no need to touch it

debugging_helpers.cpp is to help you debug; don't need to implement anything

helpers.cpp - Implement normalize() and blur()

localizer.cpp - Implement initialize_beliefs(), sense() and move()

simulate.cpp - You can uncomment portions of this to further help you develop the project, but this is not needed just to pass. See more tips below if you want to delve deeper here.
